Naming things is hard
=====================

A toy implementation of genetic programming to do symbolic regression.

I created this when I was just poking about for fun, need to tidy it up into something useful. Right now it's only set up for regression of polynomials, which is find for testing, but rather useless otherwise.

## Instructions

Modify `test-function` or set `test-domain` and `test-values` to something you want to evaluate fitness against.

If you want, modify the function and terminal sets. Functions currently must be of type `(-> Number Number Number)`

`(run-gp)`

Wooo!
